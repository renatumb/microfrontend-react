This is just a small POC to demostrate how MFE works




## Installation

To run it, first install with:

```bash
  npm install
```
---
Then run
```bash
  npm run start
```

PS.: Those commands should be ran in all 3 projects
- micro-app1
- app2
- shell-frontend

Not required, but there are 2 scripts that facilitate your life:
- **build-all.sh** : `clean` and then `npm install`, `npm build` for all 3 mini-projects
- **clean-all.sh** : it deletes from all 3 `dist` and `node_modules`
